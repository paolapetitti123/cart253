# CART253 - Exercise 8 Reflection

Having learned javascript throughout the entire semester has been quite enjoyable, despite my worries at the beginning of the semester that online courses were going to be rather difficult. While I am quite familiar with programming as I was a computer science student back in college I wasn't really familiar with javascript in particular so I did face some challenges throughout the semester. One of the most challenging elements I've faced is having to deal with collision detection however there is something that is just ridiculously satisfying when I finally get the collision detection working the way it's supposed too. Out of all the projects done this semester I would have to say that my final project is the one I am the most proud of and in part I feel like it has to do with the amount of hours I’ve spent on fine tuning the game and actually seeing what was once just an ideas I had essentially come to life because I doubted myself so much when I started this project. Asides from the projects I think one of my favourite aspects in general revolving around programming is how linear/straight-forward it can be especially with p5js, now this isn’t to say that there aren’t aspects of it that are complicated but overall it can be very straightforward once you know the language. Another aspect I love is object oriented programming, that’s a concept I am ridiculously familiar with having done computer science, I am so accustomed to object oriented programming and I actually prefer it and how organized it can make your code, like it just makes so much more sense to structure/format your code using object oriented programming. I definitely will continue programming in the future, it’s something I thoroughly enjoy and don’t see myself stopping anytime soon.
